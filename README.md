# Linear Block Coding Module for a Cognitive Radio
- Checks the incoming data on a wirless/wired RF module for error
- Sends a Linear Block Coded data while transmitting
- Goes through various phases like linear Invariant Synchronous Algorithm for synronization between transmitter and receiver
then goes through scrambler and descrambler to stabilize the crytsal in case of consecutive 1's and 0'.
- Following the different stages it transmits/recieves the data as per the given command
- Designed for LPC 17xx series of microcontrollers
